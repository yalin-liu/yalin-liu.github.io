## Gradshteyn I S, Ryzhik I M. Table of integrals, series, and products[M]. Academic press, 2014. ([Available](http://drhuang.com/science/mathematics/book/Table%20of%20Integrals,Series%20and%20Products%20Eighth%20Edition.pdf) )

The book is valued by users of previous editions of the work both for **its comprehensive coverage of integrals and special functions**, and also for its accuracy and valuable updates. Since the first edition, published in 1965, the mathematical content of this book has significantly increased due to the addition of new material, though the size of the book has remained almost unchanged. 

The new 8th edition contains entirely new results and amendments to the auxiliary conditions that accompany integrals and wherever possible most entries contain valuable references to their source.

## Chiu S N, Stoyan D, Kendall W S, et al. Stochastic geometry and its applications[M]. John Wiley & Sons, 2013.([Available](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118658222))

Stochastic geometry and spatial statistics play a fundamental role in many modern branches of physics, materials sciences, engineering, biology and environmental sciences. They offer successful models for the description of random two- and three-dimensional micro and macro structures and statistical methods for their analysis.

Stochastic Geometry and its Applications is ideally suited for researchers in physics, materials science, biology and ecological sciences as well as mathematicians and statisticians. It should also serve as a valuable introduction to **the subject for students of mathematics and statistics**.
