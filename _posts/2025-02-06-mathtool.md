1. Gradshteyn I S, Ryzhik I M. Table of integrals, series, and products[M]. Academic press, 2014. ([Available](http://drhuang.com/science/mathematics/book/Table%20of%20Integrals,Series%20and%20Products%20Eighth%20Edition.pdf) )

  The book is valued by users of previous editions of the work both for **its comprehensive coverage of integrals and special functions**, and also for its accuracy and valuable updates. Since the first edition, published in 1965, the mathematical content of this book has significantly increased due to the addition of new material, though the size of the book has remained almost unchanged.

  Stochastic Geometry and its Applications is ideally suited for researchers in physics, materials science, biology and ecological sciences as well as mathematicians and statisticians. It should also serve as a valuable introduction to **the subject for students of mathematics and statistics**.

  Offering the first comprehensive treatment of the theory of random measures, this book has a very broad scope, ranging from basic properties of Poisson and related processes to the modern theories of convergence, stationarity, Palm measures, conditioning, and compensation. The three large final chapters focus on applications within the areas of stochastic geometry, excursion theory, and branching processes.
