* Gradshteyn I S, Ryzhik I M. Table of integrals, series, and products[M]. Academic press, 2014.

The book is valued by users of previous editions of the work both for **its comprehensive coverage of integrals and special functions**, and also for its accuracy and valuable updates. Since the first edition, published in 1965, the mathematical content of this book has significantly increased due to the addition of new material, though the size of the book has remained almost unchanged. The new 8th edition contains entirely new results and amendments to the auxiliary conditions that accompany integrals and wherever possible most entries contain valuable references to their source.
